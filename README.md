# Data Structures Repository

This repository provides implementations of common data structures.

## Included Data Structures:

- **Stack**: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Queue**: A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Deque**: A double-ended queue that allows insertions and deletions from both ends.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are connected by pointers.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last element points back to the first.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list where each element has pointers to both the previous and next elements.
- **Doubly Linked Circular List**: A doubly linked list that is also circular.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A tree data structure where the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
- **Heap**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (e.g., min-heap or max-heap).
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
- **List**: A general-purpose linear data structure that can be implemented as an array or linked list.

## Usage:

 **Clone the repository**:
