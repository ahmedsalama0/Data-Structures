This program is a C++ implementation to create a binary tree and check if it is a complete binary tree and whether it satisfies min-heap or max-heap properties.

## Example Usage

1. The program builds a tree based on user inputs.
2. After constructing the tree, the program:
   - Displays the tree structure.
   - Checks and prints whether the tree is a complete binary tree.
   - Checks and prints whether the tree is a min-heap or max-heap.
