# Hash Table

# Simple Hash Table Directory in C++

This program is a basic implementation of a hash table to store contact information (names and phone numbers) using separate chaining to handle collisions.

## Example Usage

1. The program asks for contact names and phone numbers, storing them in the hash table.
2. It allows the user to add multiple contacts in a loop.
3. After all contacts are added, the program prints all stored contacts.
