# Custom-built Stack in C++

### This repository contains a simple stack implementation in C++.

### The stack uses dynamic memory allocation and features important concepts such as:

    - Dynamic memory management with `new` and `delete`.
    - Copy constructor and assignment operator overloading to ensure deep copying.
    - A static counter tracking the number of stack objects created.
    - Basic stack operations like `push`, `pop`, and a friend function for viewing stack contents.
